# Progresa Policy Analysis Project 

This group project conducts a comprehensive policy analysis of the Progresa program, focusing on its impact on children's education outcomes. A variety of econometric methods are used to assess the effectiveness of the program.

## Methodology

The analysis progresses through multiple stages, using various econometric techniques to understand the impact of the Progresa program:

**Summary Statistics**: Provides an overview of the key variables and characteristics of the dataset.

**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: A basic regression model to estimate the effect of the program on educational outcomes.

**Logistic Regression**: A model used to analyze binary outcomes, such as school attendance.

**Instrumental Variables (IV)**: Used to address potential endogeneity in the data.

**Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**: A quasi-experimental approach to estimate the causal effect of the program by comparing treated and control groups over time.
