# Progresa Policy Analysis Project 

This group project conducts a comprehensive policy analysis of the Progresa program, focusing on its impact on children's education outcomes. A variety of econometric methods are used to assess the effectiveness of the program.

## Methodology

The analysis progresses through multiple stages, using various econometric techniques to understand the impact of the Progresa program:

Summary Statistics: Provides an overview of the key variables and characteristics of the dataset.

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): A basic regression model to estimate the effect of the program on educational outcomes.

Logistic Regression: A model used to analyze binary outcomes, such as school attendance.

Instrumental Variables (IV): Used to address potential endogeneity in the data.

Difference-in-Differences (DiD): A quasi-experimental approach to estimate the causal effect of the program by comparing treated and control groups over time.

## Files

Progresa.R: The R script that contains the full analysis, including summary statistics, regression models (OLS, Logistic, IV), and DiD analysis.

ProgresaEssay.qmd: A Quarto document providing a brief description of the analysis and key findings.
